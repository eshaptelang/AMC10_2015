# This is the twelfth problem of the 2015 AMC10. There is no reasonable way to solve this in python. But, I can tell you
# how I solved this problem on paper. So, first I took the equation y^2 + (square root of pi)^4 = 2 *[(square root of pi
# )^2]*y + 1 and simplified the problem till I was at (y - pi)^2 = 1. At this point, I knew that meant that y - pi would
# either equal -1 or 1, and by taking all of the answers into consideration, I found the answer of 2.
